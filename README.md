**Objective**

This project has the objective to design and construct a solar monitoring system to display 
the values of voltage, current, power, energy, savings, and the maximum power transfer via 
Blynk 2.0 and the OLED display. The board ESP32 is used to process the results of the data from 
ACS712 current sensor module that measures the electric current value and the voltage divider 
network to sense the solar panel voltage. These values can be calculated to find the power, the 
energy, the savings in each time period.
       From the test of this solar monitoring system, it can display the voltage and the current that 
pass the ACS712 current sensor module and the voltage divider network, sending the data to the 
ESP32 and calculating the power value, the energy, and the savings. It can choose to display the 
desired display via the OLED display for displaying the results.
